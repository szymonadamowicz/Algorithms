# Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of popular sorting algorithms.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Quick Sort
Quick Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that divides the array into smaller sub-arrays based on a chosen pivot element. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
